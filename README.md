# HFT-Buy_Low_Sell_High
Creating a notebook which helps to visualize HFT data, do featurization and train a model to output predicted midprices. The idea for identifying influential and non influential trades and modelling using super computing processes like Advanced Machine Learning to predict any kind of drift in midprices (which high frequency traders take advantage of) has been drived by the paper -"Buy Low, Sell High - A high frequency trading perspective"
